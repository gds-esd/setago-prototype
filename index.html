      <h2>What is Cross Cultural Awareness? Why is it important?</h2>
      <p>
       Cultural awareness is a way of thinking about and viewing the world. It means understanding, respecting and </br>
       successfully interacting with those whose values, behaviours, customs and practices are different than your own.</br>
       When you achieve Cross Cultural Awareness, you are able to show sensitivity and acceptance of the customs, practices </br>

       It is especially important to achieve Cross Cultural Awareness as Singapore is made up of diverse cultures and religions.</br>
       Respecting the culture of different communities in Singapore is essential to maintaining peace and harmony.
